            <h1>Blackbaud experiences Cyber Breach</h1>
            <p>The Vermont Food Bank has been dealing with the aftermath of a data breach at technology provider
                Blackbaud, which led to a ransomware attack. While donors have been supportive, the food bank's leaders
                have hired a law firm to investigate and protect its interests, along with those of donors and its 215
                network partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the George W. Bush Presidential
                Center, Vermont Public Radio, the Rhode Island School of Design, and Human Rights Watch, have also
                received notices from Blackbaud. However, Blackbaud users have expressed dissatisfaction with the timing
                of the company's notification, which was several months after the attack occurred. Despite this,
                Blackbaud has reassured users that no credit card information, bank account information, or Social
                Security numbers were stolen. The attack was initially detected on May 14, and Blackbaud's cybersecurity
                team, together with independent forensics experts and law enforcement, prevented the cybercriminal from
                blocking their system access and fully encrypting files. Blackbaud confirmed that all traces of the
                cybercriminal and their attempt to regain access ceased by June 3, and they began working around the
                clock to prepare contact data and author customized, scenario-specific communications for each affected
                customer. Despite some customers questioning the speed of Blackbaud's response, they maintain that their
                top priority was to stop the cybercriminal and expel them from their system.</p>
            <p>My Halloween decorations are staying in the box this year. To be honest, they didn’t make it out of the
                box last year either. My Halloween spirit has officially been bludgeoned to death by teenagers who no
                longer care and a persistent October fear of the Northern California wildfires. And speaking of fear,
                isn’t there more than enough of that going around? Maybe all of us can pretend that Halloween isn’t even
                happening this year?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Blackbaud, a cloud software company, suffered a data breach caused by a sophisticated ransomware attack
                that compromised many nonprofit accounts globally. The company's cybersecurity team thwarted the attack
                before the criminal could lock down its network, but it still created concerns among the affected
                customers. While Blackbaud has apologized for the disruption caused, it has implemented additional
                measures to prevent future occurrences and is working closely with law enforcement agencies to mitigate
                the damage. Although the intruder's access was discovered, officials have declined to mention how many
                accounts were accessed during that period. The firm has confirmed that encrypted information, such as
                bank account details or passwords, was not accessible, and a formal report was made to the Information
                Commissioner’s Office in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obligations.
                Cybersecurity experts doubt whether Blackbaud can guarantee that the stolen data has been destroyed.
                Blackbaud hired outside experts to monitor the dark web and has denied any third-party involvement in
                the investigation.</p>
